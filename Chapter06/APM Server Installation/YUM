install APM Server using YUM repository

We need to do following for adding YUM repository of APM Server(Please change 6.x to the available version):

1) In first step we need to download the public signing key:

	sudo rpm --import https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

2) Then we need to create a .repo extension under /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory and then add the following expression:

	[elastic-6.x]
	name=Elastic repository for 6.x packages
	baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/yum
	gpgcheck=1
	gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	type=rpm-md

3) Now we can install the APM Server by execution following command:

	sudo yum install apm-server

4) To configure it to auto start after every reboot, we need to run following command:

	sudo chkconfig --add apm-server

This way we can install APM Server using YUM repository.
