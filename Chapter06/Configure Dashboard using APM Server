We can configure the dashboard loading through apm-server.yml config file using the following setting:

	setup.dashboards.enabled: true

Also, we can run the following setup command to load the dashboard from the system:

deb and rpm:

	apm-server setup --dashboards

mac:

	./apm-server setup --dashboards

docker:

	docker run docker.elastic.co/apm/apm-server:6.5.4 setup --dashboards

win: From the PowerShell prompt, change to the directory where you installed APM Server, and run:

	PS > .\apm-server.exe setup --dashboards


This way we can load Dashboards for APM data visualization and analysis.
