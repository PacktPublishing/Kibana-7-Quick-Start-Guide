X-Pack Installation on Elasticsearch

We need to install X-Pack for Elastic Stack 6.2 or older versions as from version 6.3 onwards X-Pack is coming as a default distribution with Elastic Stack. So in Elastic Stack 6.3 and onwards, we can get all free features as enabled by default while other features can be enabled by installing X-Pack.

We need to do following for installing X-Pack with Elastic Stack if our Elastic Stack version is 6.2 or older:

Stop Elasticsearch service, move to Elasticsearch installation directory and execute the following command:

bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack

Above expression will install the X-Pack plugin with Elastic Stack.

After installing X-Pack start Elasticsearch service then generate default passwords by running following commands

bin/x-pack/setup-passwords auto
