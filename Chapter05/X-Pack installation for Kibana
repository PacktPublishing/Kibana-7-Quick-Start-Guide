X-Pack Installation on Kibana

We need to install X-Pack for Elastic Stack 6.2 or older versions as from version 6.3 onwards X-Pack is coming as a default distribution with Elastic Stack. So in Elastic Stack 6.3 and onwards, we can get all free features as enabled by default while other features can be enabled by installing X-Pack.

We need to do following for installing X-Pack with Elastic Stack if our Elastic Stack version is 6.2 or older:

Stop Kibana service, move to Kibana installation directory and execute the following command:

bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack

Above expression will install the X-Pack plugin on Kibana.

After installing X-Pack start Kibana service we need to add elasticsearch.username and elasticsearch.password under kibana.yml file.

elasticsearch.username: "elastic_username"
elasticsearch.password: "elastic_password"


After updating the kibana.yml file start Kibana.
